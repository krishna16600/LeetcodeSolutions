class Solution {
    public int[] sortArrayByParity(int[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        int even = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(A[i]%2==0){
                int temp = A[even];
                A[even] = A[i];
                A[i] = temp;
                even++;
            }
        }
        return A;
    }
}

This question can be solved in many ways:
1.using in place swapping as shown above. 
2. Create a new array and by using 2 pointers, one for even and another for odd, 
initialize even with 0(index) and odd with n-1.
when we encounter even element in original array, we put the same in newArr[even] and increment even by 1
and if odd, then put odd element at newArr[odd] and decrement odd by 1.
